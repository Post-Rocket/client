      Welcome to the Post Rocket Terms of Use (also known as “Terms of Services”, and referred as “Terms”).
      <br/>
      <br/>

      <span>
        Please read these Terms carefully because they govern your use of our website/webapp/software, (the “Site”) and the
        services and products we provide. The Site and our products and services, including any of our data-inspired features and
        APIs, are collectively called the “Services”. If you have any questions, <span class='link-color'><a href="mailto:support@postrocket.app" class='link primary' target="_blank">contact us</a></span>.

      <h2>
        Agreement to terms
      </h2>

      By accessing, installing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree
      to these Terms, you may not use the Services.

      <div id='changes-to-terms-or-services' className='anchor-label'></div>

      <h2>
        Changes to terms or services
      </h2>

      Subject to any Service Level Agreement to which we have expressly agreed with you, we may modify the Terms
      and our Services at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we will notify you by posting on the Site.
      It's important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because continuing to use the Services after
      we have posted modified Terms on the Site indicates to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms.
      If you don't agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then please discontinue use of the Services immediately.
      Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any
      time and without notice to you, at our sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, these Terms shall apply
      unmodified for terms identified in any order form signed by you for the Services (each an“Order Form”) until
      each renewal of the term whereupon any updated terms and conditions shall apply.

      In order to access and use the Services, you will need to create a Product account (“Account”). By creating
      an Account you represent to us that you are thirteen (13) years or older and are not barred from using the
      Services under applicable law. By submitting information to Product in the signup process, you expressly

      is not allowed. We reserve the right to refuse your access to or use of the Services, in our sole discretion,
      if any information provided violates our Terms.
