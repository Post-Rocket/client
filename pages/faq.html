      <h2>
        Q: How did you come up with the idea?
      </h2>
      <b>A:</b> We wanted to use technology to help people. One day a dear friend of us, her name is Eugenia, asked us how she could grow her housekeeping company market. We asked if she had a website, she replied she did not. What about social medias, we followed. She said she had an Instagram and Facebook account, but she never go there to update her pages. We checked available solutions and there where all too complex, too expensive, and too time consuming for her. And that's how the idea of building a fully automated social media marketing platform adapted to small and medium businesses was born.
      <h2>
        Q: How much does it cost?
      </h2>
      <b>A:</b> It costs $0.49 a post. That means that when the AI agent posts 3 times a day, 5 days a week, it's less than $30 a month.
      <h2>
        Q: Is it a subscription?
      </h2>
      <b>A:</b> Nope. It's on-demand, $0.49 per post. It's fully adaptable to your needs. You set the posting frequency.
      <h2>
        Q: Can I post less than once a day?
      </h2>
      <b>A:</b> Yes. Our on-demand model allows you to set the frequency based on your needs.
      <h2>
        Q: Who creates and posts the content?
      </h2>
      <b>A:</b> Our AI agent, Ana, does it. Based on your business story, and on your business industry, market and competition analysis, Ana creates content hand-taylored for your business, and then post it based on your preferences.
      <h2>
        Q: Who uses the product?
      </h2>
      <b>A:</b> Mostly people who do not have time for social media marketing. Nearly half of the U.S. economy is powered by +33M small and medium businesses (SMBs), over 40% of those businesses are owned by women, and over 20% by minorities. A hard-working workforce that cranks more than 50 hours a week ― sometime working 7 days a week ― who has no time, no expertise and no money for their marketing. We are here to help, with a super intuitive <i>"set once and forget it"</i> platform at the most affordable and flexible pricing point.
